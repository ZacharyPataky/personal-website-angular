<h2>About Me</h2>
<h3>The man, the myth, the legend</h3>

<p>What took you so long?</p>
<p>My name is Zachary Pataky, and I'm a software engineer. I'm currently employed as a Full-Stack Developer at Merchants
  Insurance Group, where I'm responsible for maintaining and developing internal web portals.</p>
<p>One thing that sets me apart is my strong growth mindset. I believe that with hard work
  and a willingness to learn, anyone can achieve their goals and continually improve
  themselves. I'm always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and skillset, both in my
  professional and personal life.</p>
<p>When I'm not coding, you'll often find me playing video games, watching movies, reading books,
  or training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy perusing my websiteâ€”it took many hours and several dreadful versions before
  reaching the one you see today. Before you leave, please consider dropping me a message below.</p>
